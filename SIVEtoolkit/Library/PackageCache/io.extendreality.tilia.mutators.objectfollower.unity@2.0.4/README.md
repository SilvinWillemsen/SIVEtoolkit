## Introduction

The Object Follower prefab provides the ability to have one target GameObject follow a source GameObject with 1:1 mapping around a [Unity] scene.

This replicates the concept of having a child/parent GameObject but without the need for nesting and therefore the target is not affected by any transform changes such as position, rotation or scale changes.

> **Requires** the Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
